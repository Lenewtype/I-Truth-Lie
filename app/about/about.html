            <h2>About I Truth Lie</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>I Truth Lie</strong> was created between January of 2015 and February 25th, 2015. It is made using Angular.js for routing and handing static data (in probably the most messy and confusing way possible), as well as Bootstrap for speeding up creating a layout. Color scheme and design borrows heavy from <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html">Material Design</a> and it aims to have a fluid layout so the site is not rendered useless on mobile and tablet devices. I have been logging my changes in a GitHub repo, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/Lenewtype/I-Truth-Lie">here</a>. I used Bower to pull in components but I didn't get as far as adding in build tasks or SASS compilation (it would be kind of overkill here).

            <p>The information used on this site is taken from various sources around the internet and was refactored and rewarded to suit <strong>I Truth Lie</strong>'s needs. In addition to digging for information on auction sites and bandmen blogs, I have used the following sources:</p>

            <p>If any information is incorrect or needs to be updated, please contact me to voice your concern. I am always looking for missing content, better pictures, spell checks, and different point of views as this is a project that needs constant perfecting.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a web developer who has a fairly large interest in Japanese rock. I've been collecting CDs since 11th grade and only recently been able to really increase the size of my collection. My goal with this site, as well as sites like it that I help out with, is to preserve history and accurate document it for this scene. Unfortunately, for many years there has been a lot of misinformation being spread around, as well as mistranslations and information disappears with the sands of time. Hopefully I can do my part in being able to restore and protect this topic, as it is one I hold dear, for people after me to learn about and enjoy.</p>

            <p>In addition to owning this site, I am also a content editor for <a href="http://weloveucp.com/">We Love UCP</a>, an official reviewer for Monochrome Heaven (linked above), am an author for <a href="http://deadeyes-star.com/">Deadeyes-Star</a>, and have recently acquired ZombiexJuice (also linked above) in which I add high quality booklet scans and eventually lyrics. At one point I also ran my own review blog, but those days are over.</p>

            <p>Feel free to contact me about new information or feedback. The easiest way to reach me would be through last.fm or Twitter.</p>
