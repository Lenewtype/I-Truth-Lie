            <p>DEViL KiTTY formed after Eternal's demise, but with a decent amount of time between Yuuga's previous project, Kar'MariA. Although an official start date is unknown, it is assumed that the band became "official" sometime in October of 2002. While DEViL KiTTY is measurably Yuuga's most famous and productive band, it was not around for as long as their output would imply: the band officially split on December 4th, 2004, lasting only for a little over 2 years.</p>

            <p>Unlike any of his other bands, the first release for DEViL KiTTY was a full-length album (<strong>悪魔鬼茶</strong>), which came out on December 23rd, 2002. The band would continue to release a steady stream of material up until their second and final album, <strong>-悪魔降臨-</strong>, which dropped on August 11th, 2004. They continued to remain active, however, in spite of never releasing any material after the aforementioned album.</p>

            <p>
                Musicially, DEViL KiTTY is the quintessential style of Yuuga’s compositional style: strange guitar riffs with extremely brittle timbre, a mix of anaphylactic harsh vocals and cleans, and the use of pyschadelic keyboard. DEViL KiTTY's songs swung between a punk rock to an almost metal, while others where a more straight foward combination of alternative rock and pop-rock. Although some songs are crazier than others, not all of DEViL KiTTY’s songs were aggressive or violent: Yuuga was able to write some nice ballad-like songs, like “神様、もう一度だけ,” as well as industrial instrumental tracks, like “Ghost Dance.”

                Although DEViL KiTTY officially broke up in 2004, the band did have a final live in 2009. At this live, only four members played on stage (much like their original line-up) and a "new" song was distributed at the concert. Although the song's title was new, the song itself was "Devil a Wish" with different lyrics.

                Like many of DEViL KiTTY's contemporaries, the band went through a lot of line-up changes for one reason or another. The most famous member change, or drop, is guitarist TOTTO. Although it is hard to 100% confirm, or find legitamate information on the matter, it has been said that TOTTO sexually assaulted a fan. Aside from him being removed from the band, DEViL KiTTY is rumored to have considered ending all activties. Since there is not a wealth of information on the subject, it can only be speculated that this happened early on in the band's career since TOTTO is only present in early promotional materials. The band ultimately remained together and found several replacements for the role of guitarist. However, the band's image had a permenant scar from his actions. In addition to the sexual assault incident, Yuuga himself also developed a reputation of not being the nicest person to many of his fans. Most of the accounts of mistreating of fans usually end up being from his reaction to them trying to touching him while performing (which is not strictly limited to this band or even to just Yuuga himself, since there are cases of this happening to other musicians as well). This reputations is also intensified from the lyrical content of DEViL KiTTY's songs, such as "バンザイお洒落系," which sarcastically mocks the oshare-kei scene (since that movement began around the same time of DK's first album) as well as mocks the movement's fans for their stereotypically shallow mindset. Another song that was more than likely written out of spite was "奇形の２ちゃんネラー," based on the title having "2chan" in it. This image board has had a lot to say about Yuuga, and on his current blog he still occasionally mentions his less-than-stellar relationship with that community. In addition to this song, DEViL KiTTY's Japanese wikipedia page makes note of problems between Yuuga and 2chan, so some sort of conflict definitely occurred.
