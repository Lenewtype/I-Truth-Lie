            <h2>I Truth Lie</h2>
            <p>
                Hello and welcome to <strong>I Truth Lie</strong>, the new and improved version of a Yuuga fansite originally created in 2010. Four years later, I saught to create a better experience and presentation for the information I gathered on all of the bands and projects related to Yuuga.
            </p>
            <p>As a brief introduction, Yuuga (優雅) is a Japanese rock vocalist who has been active in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_kei">visual-kei</a> scene since the late 1990's in quite a large number of bands. During his career, he has ran two record labels, fronted 4 bands, and had a short-lived solo project. One distinct feature about Yuuga that really makes him stand out from the rest of the visual-kei scene is his tongue-in-cheek sarcasm, as well as blunt nature. It is quite common for bandmen to keep their motivations and personal lives private when they write on their blogs, leaving an air of mystery behind a smokescreen of fluff and neutral comments. However, Yuuga has proven to do the opposite and be exceedingly direct. He's also been unconventional with his marketing, especially with his current band in which most of their discography was given out for free or sold for 10 yen (around $0.08 USD). Yuuga originally retired in 2006, but became active again in 2011 after a few years of "living cool." His most famous band is DEViL KiTTY, but his current band, GOKIBURI, has recently announced that they are signed to a major label. Hopefully this means a lot more activity for the band!</p>

            <p>Since Yuuga is now currently active again in the music scene, I expect to update this site somewhat regularly depending on how fast his activities with GOKIBURI occur. When I made my first version of this fansite, I never expected him to return and didn't format my site to handle being updated effectively. </p>
