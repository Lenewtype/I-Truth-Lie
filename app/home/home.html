            <h2>I Truth Lie</h2>
            <p>
                Hello and welcome to <strong>I Truth Lie</strong>, the new and improved version of a Yuuga fansite originally created in 2010. Four years later, I saught to create a better experience and presentation for the information I gathered on all of the bands and projects related to Yuuga.
            </p>
            <p>As a brief introduction, Yuuga (優雅) is a Japanese rock vocalist who has been active in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_kei">visual-kei</a> scene since the late 1990's in quite a large number of bands. During his career, he has ran two record labels, fronted 4 bands, and had a short-lived solo project. He originally retired in 2006, but became active again in 2011 after a few years of "living cool." His most famous band is DEViL KiTTY, but his current band, GOKIBURI, has recently announced that they are signed to a major label. Hopefully this means a lot more activity for the band!</p>
            <p>Since Yuuga is now currently active again in the music scene, I expect to update this site somewhat regularly depending on how fast his activities with GOKIBURI occur. When I made my first version of this fansite, I never expected him to return and didn't format my site to handle being updated effectively. </p>
