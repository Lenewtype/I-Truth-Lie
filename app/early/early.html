      		<p>Very little is known about Yuuga's first bands other than what instruments he played and their names. The first band that he was a member of was Diana, which he was a support keyboardist for. Although the members of that band are availible on the internet, it really wouldn't be all that important to make note of them since most of them quit their musical career after the band's end. Diana only released two demo tapes in their career: one called "To find a way / Lonliness" and another entitled "Eyes."</p>
         	<p>Yuuga's second band was Celestier. It isn't really known what part he had in that band since there isn't any infomration on any of the members aside from it having the same vocalist as Diana.</p>
